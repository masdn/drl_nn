# CS491 CPU NN Assignment 1: Dylan Rivas + Miles Nordwall

## INTRODUCTION
- Describe the dataset and the supervised learning problem
- Explain what questions we're trying to answer with the neural network
- Mention the swept volume prediction task

## METHODOLOGY
- Describe our neural network architecture (feedforward, hidden layers, ReLU activation)
- Explain the supervised learning approach we implemented
- Detail loss function (MSE), optimizer (Adam), and training process
- Mention data splits (training, validation, testing)
- Explain model selection using validation loss

## ASSIGNMENT RESULTS - CPU
- Include plots of evaluation losses versus epochs
- Create table showing convergence, performance, and training time effects
- Compare different learning rates and training data sizes
- Show best validation loss achieved and corresponding test performance
- Document training time measurements and analysis
## SELF DIRECTED RESULTS
- Present variant neural network architecture or training modifications implemented
- Document hypothesis about expected performance changes and reasoning
- Show experimental results comparing baseline vs. modified approach
- Include evaluation loss plots for both configurations
- Analyze testing loss values and performance differences
- Discuss whether hypothesis was confirmed or refuted
- Explain insights gained from the self-directed experiment
## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
- Miles: Used Cursor IDE with claude-4-sonnet and gpt-5 in the chat window to give context and ask questions about the code.
